            Commissaire Georges Dupinâ€™s holiday plans are rudely interrupted
            when someone pushes a noted doctor out of a top-floor window in the
            French harbor city of Concarneau. As the cantankerous but brilliant
            Dupin searches for the killer, he uncovers hidden, cutthroat
            political and social rivalries that roil beneath the surface.
